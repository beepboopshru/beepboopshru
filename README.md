## 🚀 About Me

I'm a final-year Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics undergraduate at Christ (Deemed to Be University), Bangalore. My passion lies at the intersection of theoretical research and practical innovation—whether it's simulating celestial mechanics, developing Discord bots, or leading creative teams in music and theatre.

Curiosity drives me to explore astrophysics, particle physics, and computational modeling. I thrive on solving complex problems, building collaborative communities, and bringing fun energy (and great stickers!) to every group.
